<User Requirement Map>
Discussion Mode (Discussion):
Fixed dual roles: Cognito answers first, Muse questions/supplements, iterating based on 'Fixed Rounds / AI Driven'.
Final Output: Cognito is responsible for synthesizing the discussion and writing the final answer to the right-side Notebook using notepad commands (e.g., np-replace-all).
Multi-modal: User text can include images, serving as a shared context for both AIs.
MoE Mode (Mixture of Experts, Three-stage parallel hardcoded pipeline):
R1 Parallel: R1A and R1B simultaneously receive {{user_prompt}} (including image) and generate their respective results.
R2 Parallel: After R1 completes, R2C and R2D are triggered simultaneously; R2C receives {{user_prompt}} + {{stage1_a_result}}; R2D receives {{user_prompt}} + {{stage1_b_result}}.
R3 Aggregation: Summarizer receives {{user_prompt}} + {{stage1_a_result}} + {{stage1_b_result}} + {{stage2_c_result}} + {{stage2_d_result}}, and must use np-replace-all to write the final answer to the Notebook.
Circuit Breaker: If any parallel request fails, the current MoE process is immediately interrupted, and the failed step is clearly marked in the UI.
Page Layout

Two-column layout: Left side is the 'Message/Execution Area', right side is the 'Notepad (Notebook)', with a draggable divider in the middle to adjust width.
Top Bar: Displays application title, entry buttons (App Settings âš™, Team Management ðŸ‘¥, Clear Session); removes the legacy Cognito/Muse model selectors after a team preset is enabled.
Notebook (Right Column): Supports Markdown preview/source toggle, full screen, copy, undo/redo; serves as the sole container for the final answer.
UI Effects

Discussion Mode: The left side displays user/system/Cognito/Muse messages in linear chat bubbles; system bubbles are used for progress, error, and retry notifications.
MoE Mode: A unified 'MoE Parallel Execution' container appears on the left, containing four collapsible cards (R1A/R1B/R2C/R2D):
Cards show "Thinking..."/loading animation during execution, display Markdown-rendered content upon completion, and show an error state on failure.
The Aggregator (R3) does not display its answer in this container but writes the final result to the Notebook.
Running Status: Displays the current processing time and the last round number (in Discussion Mode) in the header/footer area, and maintains an auto-scroll-to-bottom user experience.
Errors and Retries: On failure, clearly indicates the failed node in the message area; MoE mode triggers the circuit breaker; Discussion mode retains automatic and manual retry capabilities.
Configuration Page

App Settings (âš™, Global items only, Tabbed format):
General Settings: Font size scaling.
API Channels: Channel manager (Add/Edit/Delete/List), each channel includes provider type (OpenAI Compatible/Gemini, etc.), Base URL, API Key, default model, timeout, capability flags (whether it supports system prompt/images/thinking config).
Team Management (ðŸ‘¥, Located to the left of the App Settings entry, two-column layout):
Left Column: Team list and 'Activate' button; supports creating/selecting a team.
Right Column: Team editor, first select a mode (Discussion or MoE).
Discussion Team: Two role areas (Cognito, Muse); select discussion mode (Fixed Rounds / AI Driven) and number of rounds; each role can be configured with a display name, the API channel to use, model ID, system prompt, and User Prompt template.
MoE Team: Five fixed role areas (R1A, R1B, R2C, R2D, Summarizer), which can also be configured with a display name, channel, model ID, system prompt, and User Prompt template; available template variables (e.g., {{user_prompt}}, {{stage1_a_result}}, etc.) are listed as a read-only hint below each step.
Role Parameters (Simplified controls instead of JSON): Controls with toggles are used to enable/disable and set
Model Temperature (Temperature, 0â€“2, slider + toggle)
Topâ€‘P (0â€“1, slider + toggle)
reasoning_effort (low/medium/high, dropdown + toggle, OpenAI ChatGPT exclusive)
verbosity (low/medium/high, dropdown + toggle, OpenAI ChatGPT exclusive)
All team/channel configurations are persisted to local storage; after a team is activated, the chat execution flow automatically switches according to the team mode (Discussion or MoE).

# Instructions

You are a multi-agent system coordinator, playing two roles in this environment: Planner and Executor. You will decide the next steps based on the current state in the `scratchpad.md` file. Your goal is to complete the user's final requirements.

When the user asks for something to be done, you will take on one of two roles: the Planner or Executor. Any time a new request is made, the human user will ask to invoke one of the two modes. If the human user doesn't specifiy, please ask the human user to clarify which mode to proceed in.

The specific responsibilities and actions for each role are as follows:

## Role Descriptions

1. Planner
   - Responsibilities: Perform high-level analysis, break down tasks, define success criteria, evaluate current progress. The human user will ask for a feature or change, and your task is to think deeply and document a plan so the human user can review before giving permission to proceed with implementation. When creating task breakdowns, make the tasks as small as possible with clear success criteria. Do not overengineer anything, always focus on the simplest, most efficient approaches.
   - Actions: Revise the `scratchpad.md` file to update the plan accordingly.
2. Executor
   - Responsibilities: Execute specific tasks outlined in `scratchpad.md`, such as writing code, running tests, handling implementation details, etc.. The key is you need to report progress or raise questions to the human at the right time, e.g. after completion some milestone or after you've hit a blocker. Simply communicate with the human user to get help when you need it.
   - Actions: When you complete a subtask or need assistance/more information, also make incremental writes or modifications to `scratchpad.md `file; update the "Current Status / Progress Tracking" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections; if you encounter an error or bug and find a solution, document the solution in "Lessons" to avoid running into the error or bug again in the future.

## Document Conventions

- The `scratchpad.md` file is divided into several sections as per the above structure. Please do not arbitrarily change the titles to avoid affecting subsequent reading.
- Sections like "Background and Motivation" and "Key Challenges and Analysis" are generally established by the Planner initially and gradually appended during task progress.
- "High-level Task Breakdown" is a step-by-step implementation plan for the request. When in Executor mode, only complete one step at a time and do not proceed until the human user verifies it was completed. Each task should include success criteria that you yourself can verify before moving on to the next task.
- "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" are mainly filled by the Executor, with the Planner reviewing and supplementing as needed.
- "Project Status Board" serves as a project management area to facilitate project management for both the planner and executor. It follows simple markdown todo format.

## Workflow Guidelines

- After you receive an initial prompt for a new task, update the "Background and Motivation" section, and then invoke the Planner to do the planning.
- When thinking as a Planner, always record results in sections like "Key Challenges and Analysis" or "High-level Task Breakdown". Also update the "Background and Motivation" section.
- When you as an Executor receive new instructions, use the existing cursor tools and workflow to execute those tasks. After completion, write back to the "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections in the `scratchpad.md` file.
- Adopt Test Driven Development (TDD) as much as possible. Write tests that well specify the behavior of the functionality before writing the actual code. This will help you to understand the requirements better and also help you to write better code.
- Test each functionality you implement. If you find any bugs, fix them before moving to the next task.
- When in Executor mode, only complete one task from the "Project Status Board" at a time. Inform the user when you've completed a task and what the milestone is based on the success criteria and successful test results and ask the user to test manually before marking a task complete.
- Continue the cycle unless the Planner explicitly indicates the entire project is complete or stopped. Communication between Planner and Executor is conducted through writing to or modifying the `scratchpad.md` file.
  "Lesson." If it doesn't, inform the human user and prompt them for help to search the web and find the appropriate documentation or function.

Please note:
- Note the task completion should only be announced by the Planner, not the Executor. If the Executor thinks the task is done, it should ask the human user planner for confirmation. Then the Planner needs to do some cross-checking.
- Avoid rewriting the entire document unless necessary;
- Avoid deleting records left by other roles; you can append new paragraphs or mark old paragraphs as outdated;
- When new external information is needed, you can inform the human user planner about what you need, but document the purpose and results of such requests;
- Before executing any large-scale changes or critical functionality, the Executor should first notify the Planner in "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" to ensure everyone understands the consequences.
- During your interaction with the human user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `scratchpad.md` file so you will not make the same mistake again.
- When interacting with the human user, don't give answers or responses to anything you're not 100% confident you fully understand. The human user is non-technical and won't be able to determine if you're taking the wrong approach. If you're not sure about something, just say it.

### User Specified Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding

<Current Project Status>
Of course. Here is the formal and concise English translation:

***

### **Objectives**

**a. User Message & UI Consistency**
*   **Problem:** The MoE branch fails to write user messages to the message list. UI elements (top buttons, status bar) use `isLoading` instead of the unified `uiIsLoading` state. The "Clear Chat" action often fails because the MoE process is not properly terminated, allowing its outputs to overwrite the cleared state.
*   **Objective:** User messages must be inserted immediately upon sending. All loading and disabled states must be governed by `uiIsLoading`. The "Clear Chat" action in MoE mode must effectively terminate the process and clear both the message list and the Notebook.

**b. Progressive Display of MoE's Four Cards**
*   **Problem:** `useMoeLogic` updates `stepsState` in a single batch after `runMoePipeline` completes, causing all four cards to appear simultaneously rather than progressively.
*   **Objective:** Results for R1A and R1B should be displayed as soon as each task completes. R2C and R2D should start only after both R1 tasks are finished, with their results also displayed progressively. The Summarizer's output should continue to update the Notebook only, without generating a chat bubble.

**c. Ineffective "Clear Chat" in MoE Mode**
*   **Problem:** The "Clear Chat" function only invokes the stop logic for Discussion mode (`stopChatLogicGeneration`) and fails to terminate the MoE process. Consequently, downstream tasks write back to the Notebook, making the clear operation appear to have failed.
*   **Objective:** When "Clear Chat" is triggered during an active MoE session, the MoE process must be terminated first to prevent further writes. Subsequently, the message list and Notebook must be cleared, and the MoE step states must be reset to hide the `MoaBubble`.

### **Implementation Plan (by file/granularity)**

**1. Unify User Message & UI State**
*   **`dual-ai-chat/App.tsx`**
    *   `onSendMessageUnified` (MoE branch): Before calling `startMoeProcessing`, invoke `addMessage(message, MessageSender.User, MessagePurpose.UserInput, undefined, image)` to insert the user's message.
    *   Image construction: If a `File` object exists, convert it to a base64 data URL (`data:<mime>;base64,<data>`) and include its `name` and `type`.
    *   Update the `disabled` condition for top buttons, the model selector, and the status bar to use `uiIsLoading` instead of `isLoading` for consistent behavior.
        *   *Reference*: Current `isLoading` references are in `App.tsx` at lines ~551, 556, 561.
    *   `handleStopGenerating`: Ensure this is a unified entry point (already implemented), calling `stopMoeGenerating` for MoE mode and `stopChatLogicGeneration` for Discussion mode.

**2. Implement Progressive Display of Step Results (No change to stage dependencies)**
*   **`dual-ai-chat/services/moeRunner.ts`**
    *   Add an optional callback parameter: `onStepUpdate(step: MoaStepResult)`.
    *   Invoke `onStepUpdate` with the `MoaStepResult` immediately after each individual step's Promise (p1A, p1B, p2C, p2D) resolves. Stage progression will still `await Promise.all([...])` to ensure both steps in a stage are complete before proceeding.
*   **`dual-ai-chat/hooks/useMoeLogic.ts`**
    *   Pass the `onStepUpdate` callback through to `runMoePipeline`.
    *   On callback invocation, update the state via `setStepsState(prev => ({ ...prev, [stepId]: newResult }))` to enable progressive rendering.
    *   Discard these updates if `cancelRef.current` is `true` (i.e., during a cancellation or clear operation).

**3. Enable "Clear Chat" in MoE Mode**
*   **`dual-ai-chat/hooks/useMoeLogic.ts`**
    *   Implement a new function `resetMoeState()` to reset the four `stepsState` entries to their initial "thinking" status and clear the internal `cancelRef` flag.
*   **`dual-ai-chat/App.tsx`**
    *   Modify `handleClearChat` to use `uiIsLoading` to determine if a process is active:
        *   If in MoE mode and running: First, call `stopMoeGenerating()` (to set `cancelRef` and block subsequent writes), then execute `initializeChat()`.
        *   If in MoE mode and idle: Execute `initializeChat()` directly.
    *   In MoE mode, call `resetMoeState()` after clearing to hide the `MoaBubble`.
    *   Confirm the operational sequence: 1. Stop process (if active) â†’ 2. Clear messages & Notebook â†’ 3. Reset MoE steps.

### **Observability & Safeguards (for acceptance testing)**

*   **`roleRunner.runRole` (Dev-only flag):** Log a truncated snippet of the rendered `userPrompt`. If any `{{...}}` placeholders remain, log a warning like "Unrecognized variable" to help identify template issues. This should be disabled in production.
*   **`onSummarizerReady`:** If no `<np-*>` tags are found in the parsed output, log a system message like "Summarizer output contained no Notebook tags; Notebook not updated" to prevent misinterpretation.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

**a. User Message & UI**
*   When a message is sent in MoE mode, the user's message appears immediately. Top buttons and the model selector are disabled during generation. The "Stop" and "Clear" buttons function correctly.

**b. Progressive Display**
*   When either R1A or R1B completes, its card is displayed. Once both R1 tasks are finished, R2C and R2D begin, and their cards are also displayed as they complete. R3 continues to only write to the Notebook.

**c. Effective "Clear Chat"**
*   Clicking "Clear Chat" during an MoE run immediately stops further writes. The message area is cleared, the Notebook is reset, and the `MoaBubble` disappears.

**d. Regression**
*   Discussion mode functionality remains unchanged. The "Clear Chat" feature works consistently in both modes.

***

If this plan is approved, I will proceed with implementation in the following order:

A. Unify user message insertion and UI disabled states.
C. Enable effective "Clear Chat" in MoE mode (stop + reset).
B. Implement progressive display (via `onStepUpdate` callback chain).

I will document the results of each step in the `AGENT.md` memory log upon completion. Shall I begin with step A?
